        <p>Ducks are a type of waterfowl that belong to the family Anatidae, which also includes geese and swans. They
            are commonly found in or near bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes, rivers, and wetlands, and are known for
            their webbed feet, waterproof feathers, and broad, flat bills. <br><br>

            Ducks come in a variety of species and breeds, each with their own unique physical characteristics and
            behaviors. Some of the most well-known duck species include mallards, wood ducks, and Muscovy ducks.<br> <br>

            Ducks are also popular domesticated animals, raised for their meat, eggs, and feathers. They are often kept
            as pets or used for decorative purposes in ponds and water gardens.</p>
