      Numerous species of waterfowl in the Anatidae family go by the common name "duck." They are broken up into
      multiple subfamilies and are smaller and have shorter necks than swans and geese. Since they are primarily
      aquatic, ducks can be found in both fresh and salt water. They are occasionally mistaken for unrelated water birds
      like coots, dives, grebes, gallinules, or loons.

      <h2>Meals</h2>

      - Dabbling ducks use their bill's edge to filter water and catch food particles.
      <br>- Sea ducks and diving ducks forage far below the surface. Mergansers are equipped to catch and devour big
      fish, while others have a distinctive wide flat bill.

      <h2>Communication</h2>

      - Female mallard ducks make the classic "quack" sound, while males make a similar but raspier sound that is
      sometimes written as "breeeeze". However, most species of duck do not "quack", and instead make a range of
      calls, including whistles, cooing, yodels and grunts.

      <h2>Predators</h2>
      Ducks have many predators.
      <br> <br>
      - Ducklings are particularly vulnerable, since their inability to fly makes them easy
      prey not only for predatory birds but also for large fish like pike, crocodilians, predatory testudines such as
      the alligator snapping turtle, and other aquatic hunters, including fish-eating birds such as herons. Ducks' nests
      are raided by land-based predators, and brooding females may be caught unaware on the nest by mammals, such as
      foxes, or large birds, such as hawks or owls.
      <br>
      - Adult ducks are fast fliers, but may be caught on the water by large aquatic predators including big fish such
      as
      the North American muskie and the European pike. In flight, ducks are safe from all but a few predators such as
      humans and the peregrine falcon, which uses its speed and strength to catch ducks.
